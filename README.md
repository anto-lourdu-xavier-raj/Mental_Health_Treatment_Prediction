# I'm happy to announce that Alejandro, Aditya Dube, and I have built a machine learning model that can effectively identify mental health problems in workers early on. We preprocessed and tested a variety of models, such as logistic regression, KNN, and decision trees, using the Mental Health in Tech survey dataset from Kaggle. As the best performance, the AdaBoost Classifier achieved an accuracy of 81.22% and an AUC score of 0.87. This model highlights the crucial role that AI plays in improving workplace productivity and mental health by demonstrating the possibility for early intervention and support for employee well-being. #TechForGood #MachineLearning #MentalHealth #EmployeeWellbeing #AI
